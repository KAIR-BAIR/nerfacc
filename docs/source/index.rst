NerfAcc Documentation
===================================

NerfAcc is a PyTorch Nerf acceleration toolbox for both training and inference. 

Using NerfAcc, 

- The `vanilla Nerf model`_ with 8-layer MLPs can be trained to *better quality* (+~0.5 PNSR) \
  in *1 hour* rather than *1~2 days* as in the paper.
- The `instant-ngp Nerf model`_ can be trained to *equal quality* with *9/10th* of the training time (4.5 minutes) \
  comparing to the official pure-CUDA implementation.
- The `D-Nerf model`_ for *dynamic* objects can also be trained in *1 hour* \
  rather than *2 days* as in the paper, and with *better quality* (+~0.5 PSNR).
- *Unbounded scenes* from `MipNerf360`_ can also be trained in \
  *~1 hour* and get comparable quality to the paper.

*And it is pure python interface with flexible apis!*

.. note::

   This repo is focusing on the single scene situation. Generalizable Nerfs across \
   multiple scenes is currently out of the scope of this repo. But you may still find
   some useful tricks in this repo. :)
